# Personal Website
Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This project displays my work as a software developer with both a modern web design and older-style 3D graphics. 
Below, you'll find details about how it was made, what it includes, and how to use the site.

## Features

### Two Design Styles:
- **Modern Interface:** A clean, easy-to-use layout inspired by Brittany Chiang's website. This part shows all important information in a simple, easy-to-navigate format.
- **3D Retro Interface:** An old-style computer terminal inspired by Ed Hinrichsen's website. This includes a working terminal on a 3D computer screen.

### 3D Graphics:
- **WebGL2:** The retro part uses WebGL2 for drawing, written from scratch.
- **Custom Visual Effects:** Includes special effects, shadows, and other graphics techniques.
- **3D Model Loading:** A custom system for loading 3D models.
- **Original Models:** All 3D models were created by me.

### Working Terminal:
- Use the retro interface by typing commands. Look through files, find information, and enjoy an old-style computing experience.

### Simple Website Structure:
- The site is static and uses only front-end code, hosted on GitHub Pages. No server code is used.
